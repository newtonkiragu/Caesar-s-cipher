# Project Title
Cipher

## AUTHOR
  The project was created by Newton Kiragu.

### Description of the project
This app is used to encrypt messages. It takes input from the user and jumbles up the words so that anyone else reading the text wil think they are just random texts.

#### Front end logic of the app
The app receives input from the user. It only allows for an input of text only and no numbers.

#### Back end logic of the app
The app Takes the input from the user then performs the following check:
- The app confirms wether the user has input text.
- That having been confirmed, the app then checks whether the text has any characters like commas and foolstops. It then goes ahead and gets rid of them
- Next, the app counts the number of letters and confirms whether the number of letters sum up to a number that's a perfect square. If thats correct, the app arranges the letters in a table from left to right. by default, the app sets the number of rows and colums to be the square root of the number of letters.
